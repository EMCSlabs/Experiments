# A Run to Remember (191 words)
Cowboy was without a doubt the ugliest horse in the world. Even so, I
loved him beyond all reason. I realized that my only chance to compete
would be in the speed events, since events based on appearance were out of
the question. I chose barrel racing and came in next to last, while Becky,
who rode a big brown thoroughbred mare, won every time. For the whole next
month I woke up early every day and rode Cowboy five miles to the arena and
trained. On the way home from the arena, I would be so tired; those five
miles seemed twice as long. In the following competition, I sat at the gate
while I watched Becky and her horse race through the course with ease. My
turn finally came. At the signal, we dashed toward the first barrel,
whipped around it and with perfect precision rounded the second and the
third. When we passed the finish line, the crowd was silent. We had beaten
Becky and her thoroughbred! I realized then that no matter what the odds,
I'd always come out a winner if I worked hard for it.
