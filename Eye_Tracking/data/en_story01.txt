# The Descent (166 words)
Alex and Tim are lost.  Alex's wife recently passed away and he couldn't
find the motivation to live a normal life. Tim has been charged with
embezzlement and is going to prison soon. The thought of that terrified
him. They decided to take a ride down the river rapids at Cataract Canyon.
A river only goes one way. If you are lost, that is good. Alex has never
rafted on this river before, but Tim has many times. Tim tells Alex that
the rapids can be a dangerous place.  Boats can overturn and people fall
in.  Concerned, Alex asks a river guide for advice. The guide tells him
"sometimes things don't go as planned on the river, and they turn for the
worst. You find yourself struggling, fighting against the force of the
river. When that happens in nature, it's best to surrender. You'd never
hear a football coach tell you that, to surrender, but on the river it's
okay."
