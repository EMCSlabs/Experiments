# Beauty Forever (99 words)
The trial pack of Beauty-Forever pills made the couple feel more attractive
than either had ever imagined possible. Suddenly their marriage was filled
with more laughter, more cuddling, more passionate sex more often.
Convinced, they became loyal customers. One day, lying in bed, their
seemingly perfect bodies naked and spent together, the wife said, "Did you
think I was beautiful before?" The husband said, "Of course I did." She
replied, "Then let's stop taking the pills. Let's see each other as we
really are." The husband looked at her, radiant beside him and said,
"Maybe tomorrow, dear. Maybe tomorrow."
